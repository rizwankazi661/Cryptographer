# Cryptographer

•	The sole purpose of the algorithms developed for cryptography is to hide data from the attacker or middleman.

•	Crptographer stores and transmits data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. 

•	It not only protects data from theft or alteration, but can also be used for user authentication.



# Preview

The app’s homepage will give the user two option:

•	Encryption: It is the process of transforming a readable message into an unreadable one. To do so we use encoding algorithms.

•	Decryption: It is the process of transforming data or information from an unreadable to readable form. To do so we use decoding algorithms.

#Encryption 

•	There will be an EditText to input the text that is to be encrypted. Below that we will have a Button to encrypt the text.

•	To display the encrypted code we have another TextView with a Button to copy it.

#Decryption

•There will be an EditText to input the encrypted code that is to be decrypted. Below that we will have a Button to decrypt the text. 

•	To display the decrypted code we have another TextView.
