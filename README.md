# Cryptographer

•	The sole purpose of the algorithms developed for cryptography is to hide data from the attacker or middleman.

•	Crptographer stores and transmits data in a particular form so that only those for whom it is intended can read and process it. 

•	It not only protects data from theft or alteration, but can also be used for user authentication.

The app’s homepage will give the user two option:

•	Encryption: It is the process of transforming a readable message into an unreadable one. To do so we use encoding algorithms.

•	Decryption: It is the process of transforming data or information from an unreadable to readable form. To do so we use decoding algorithms.
